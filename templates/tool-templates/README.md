## What Each Sample Demonstrates

All samples include comprehensive examples of:

### ToolBox API Integration

✅ Connection management with real-time updates  
✅ Notification system (success, info, warning, error)  
✅ Clipboard operations  
✅ File save/load dialogs  
✅ Theme detection (light/dark)  
✅ Terminal creation and command execution  
✅ Event subscription and handling

### Dataverse API Integration

✅ FetchXML query execution  
✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
✅ Entity metadata retrieval  
✅ Error handling and validation

### Development Best Practices

✅ TypeScript with full type safety (`@pptb/types`)  
✅ Modern build tooling (Vite)  
✅ Component-based architecture  
✅ State management patterns  
✅ Event-driven architecture  
✅ Responsive UI design  
✅ Production-ready builds

### Build Configuration for PPTB Compatibility

Framework samples (React, Vue, Svelte) use Vite with special configuration for PPTB:

✅ **IIFE Format**: Builds use Immediately Invoked Function Expression instead of ES modules for compatibility with PPTB's iframe loading mechanism  
✅ **Single Bundle**: All code and CSS bundled into one file to avoid module loading issues  
✅ **HTML Optimization**: Custom plugin that:

- Removes `type="module"` and `crossorigin` attributes for proper loading with `file://` URLs
- Moves script tags to end of `<body>` so DOM elements are available when IIFE executes  
  ✅ **No External Dependencies**: All dependencies bundled together for standalone execution

## Development Workflow

### Development Mode (React/Vue/Svelte only)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts development server with hot module replacement. Note: ToolBox APIs are only available when loaded within the application.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates optimized production build in `dist/` directory.

### Type Checking

All samples include TypeScript for type safety:

```bash
# React/Vue/Svelte
npm run check  # or tsc for HTML

# Shows type errors without building
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Errors

**Problem**: TypeScript errors during build  
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

### API Not Available

**Problem**: `window.toolboxAPI` is undefined  
**Solution**: The tool must be loaded within Power Platform Tool Box, not a standalone browser

### Connection Null

**Problem**: Connection is always null  
**Solution**: Create a connection in Power Platform Tool Box first

### HMR Not Working

**Problem**: Changes don't reflect immediately  
**Solution**: Restart dev server with `npm run dev`
